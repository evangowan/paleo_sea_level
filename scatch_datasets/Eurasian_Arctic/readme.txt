Northern_Russia.ods - From the Baranskaya et al (2018) Holsea formatted northern Russia dataset. I formatted this dataset in a pre-1.0 release, but hopefully there are no errors. I copied the original scratch datasets into this spreadsheet if I ever have the need to check again. I copied the formatted sheets from the current database. It appears that I took the radiocarbon ages from the corrected column, so the ages should be corrected for fractionation, and bulk ages have an extra 100 years applied to the uncertainty. Baranskaya et al took the reservoir ages from the Calib database, so I am updating that with the current values.
Creel_Russia.ods - The Creel et al (2022) database included one paper with Russian data that was not in the Baranskaya dataset. See the notes in the Europe folder for more details on what I did.
