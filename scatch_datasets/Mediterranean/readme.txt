General note:
Bulk sediment, gyttja and peat dates are given a correction of 0Â±100 years to account for bulk effects.

Vacchi_NW_Mediterranean_2018.ods - I applied the marine curve to Lithophyllum byssoides samples, which was based on the results from Faivre et al (2019), which suggested the reservoir age for this coraline algae is not substantially different than from molluscs. The samples of Posidonia oceanica from Pascucci et al (2018) have mixed terrestrial and marine calibration values, but the table from that paper is messed up. The fraction marine is determined from the d13C value. The d13C values appear to be out of order as well. Without any guidance, I am just using the average from the values in the table. Vacchi et al (2017) also has Posidonia oceanica samples, that were considered to be marine. I have left the calibration as pure marine for these samples. The location information for the data from Blazquez et al (2017), Rodriguez-Perez et al (2018) and Poher et al (2017) was incorrect, so I fixed that.
Vacchi_W_Mediterranean_2016.ods - I have excluded the regions that were covered in the 2018 update (Spain and central islands). Most of the data are radiocarbon dates (which have been corrected for fractionation) and archeologically constrained points.
