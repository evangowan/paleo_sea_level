Hall et al 2010 - I used the reported ±5 m uncertainty for all of the data. The locations were estimated from a map overlain on Google Earth
Mesters Vig, Washburn and Stuiver 1962 - The samples are from diamiction (described as "till like material", possibly glaciomarine?) and deltaic sediments. I set everything to be marine limiting without further interpretation. The locations are based on a map in the paper, overlain on Google Earth. The shell dates were given a 550 correction, based on a modern shell date, so I added that back to get the conventional date. I assume that the dates were corrected for fractionation based on the notes from Yale University. I used a reservoir correction of 150±70 based on the modern shell they measured
Trautman 1963 - I added all the Greenland samples from Isotopes III. They gave only limited details and measurements in imperial units. I applied a 20% uncertainty to the stated elevation. For the places far to the north, since there is no information on the reservoir age, I used 0±200, which should cover it.
Hjort 1981, NE Greenland - applied a 20% uncertainty on elevation measurements. Used a 140±100 reservoir age (the 100 years is the same as in Hall et al 2010). Most of the detailed information is in Lund XI.
Weidick 1977 - a radiocarbon date list. I converted the beach ridge data to index points using IMCalc
Weidick 1976 - a radiocarbon date list. I converted the beach ridge and beach data to index points using IMCalc. The Helsinki data sometimes had d13C measurements, which I used for correcting fractionation. I am assuming the Copenhagen dates were normalized to 0 permille, as per Funder (1982).
Lund Radiocarbon - I decided to do all the dates reported in Lund radiocarbon date lists together. They correct for fractionation. Some samples dated both the inner and outer fraction of the shells, I included only the inner fraction dates. I checked all 21 date lists that are found in the journal Radiocarbon and added any relevant Greenland data.
