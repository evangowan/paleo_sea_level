Hall et al 2010 - I used the reported ±5 m uncertainty for all of the data. The locations were estimated from a map overlain on Google Earth
Mesters Vig, Washburn and Stuiver 1962 - The samples are from diamiction (described as "till like material", possibly glaciomarine?) and deltaic sediments. I set everything to be marine limiting without further interpretation. The locations are based on a map in the paper, overlain on Google Earth. The shell dates were given a 550 correction, based on a modern shell date, so I added that back to get the conventional date. I assume that the dates were corrected for fractionation based on the notes from Yale University. I used a reservoir correction of 150±70 based on the modern shell they measured
Trautman 1963 - I added all the Greenland samples from Isotopes III. They gave only limited details and measurements in imperial units. I applied a 20% uncertainty to the stated elevation. For the places far to the north, since there is no information on the reservoir age, I used 0±200, which should cover it.
