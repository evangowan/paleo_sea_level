- Most of the data are taken from the compilation by Briggs and Tarasov.  The reservoir ages for Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea are taken from the Calib database. For the Windmill Islands, I use the reported correction. The penguin and seal remains use a custom reservoir correction. As per Heaton et al (2023), 150 years is subtracted from the old reservoir correction.  ------ NO LONGER USED SINCE IT IS SUPERCEDED BY LECAVALIER ET AL 2022 --------
- Braddock et al 2022 - The reservoir age for these data was taken directly from the paper rather than from the Calib database, as it was already corrected for use in Marine20
- Ishiwa et al 2022 - There are no data points in the Calib database, so I used the values from the paper. As per Heaton et al (2023), 150 years is subtracted from the old reservoir correction. A nominal uncertainty of 100 years is also included.
Hjort_James_Ross_Island.ods - data from James Ross Island from Hjort et al 1997
Lecavalier_2022_PaleoRSL.ods - This is an update of the Briggs and Tarasov database with many more data. It includes the Braddock et al 2022 dataset, but I am using the version that I added before. The data that are in Ishiwa et al 2022 are also excluded. I have used a bulk terrestrial uncertainty of 100 years, as is standard. It does not appear that the old radiocarbon dates were corrected for fractionation, but the dates where this would apply are marine mammals, and it is not clear what would be appropriate. The OSL dates have a number of really old samples, which are not included since Simkins et al stated they were anomalous. The material field for Zurbuchen and Simms 2019 data was not entered, so I did this.
