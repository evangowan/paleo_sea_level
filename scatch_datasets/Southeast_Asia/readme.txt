- Huon_Peninsula_Hibbert.ods - This is the coral data from Huon Peninsula using the two sigma statistical ranges from Hibbert et al 2016.
- Hanebuth_Sunda_Shelf.ods - mostly data from the papers by Hanebuth from the Sunda Shelf
- Xisha_speleothem.ods - This has some LGM aged sea level limits from submerged speleothems

SEAMIS - this contains most of the data considered reliable from the SEAMIS dataset in Mann et al 2019. Note, in going through this, I corrected a number of errors and added information, though in some cases I did not fix noted errors. This information is as follows:

> I noticed that in the entries from Thailand that the data with the lab code "MR" were added (and calibrated) as radiocarbon dates. However, these are actually OSL dates. A few of them are actually last interglacial in age, by the looks of it. 
>  The radiocarbon dates from Kamaludin (2001) are entered incorrectly - they are peats and do not need a reservoir correction. The coordinates are also incorrect because it appears that they were taken directly from the Horton et al (2005) compilation rather than the original paper, and Horton et al made some mistakes. This results in some sites plotting on the east side of the peninsula, when they are actually located on the west side.
> The sites from Tjia et al (1983) (radiocarbon dates GAK-9558 to GAK-9567) also have the wrong coordinates, because the coordinates were also taken from Horton et al (2005) rather than the original paper. It is not as severe as the other paper, though. 
> Berhala_Strait - The database has two dates, but in reality it is simply one radiocarbon date with a reported non-Gaussian distribution. I used the larger error.
> I had a difficult time understanding where there age values from Meltzner et al. (2017) come from. The numbers do not match anything in the paper. The paper mentions 25 index points, the appendix mentions 20 radiocarbon dates. SEAMIS has 25 points, which is consistent with the values stated in the paper. I added a nominal error of 20 years, because that is consistent with the modelled radiocarbon dates.
> In Ca Na, Vietnam, the material that was dated is not in SEAMIS. It is all marine material, though.
> The coordinates in Azmy et al (2010) located in Java are incorrect. Also, in the paper, they report both radiocarbon and U/Th dates, and suggest that the radiocarbon dates are too young. The SEAMIS database only includes the radiocarbon dates, so I think this needs to be looked at.
> Dates by de Klerk (1982) in Sulawesi have some samples with reservoir correction, but they are peat and loam, so probably should be considered terrestrial. Some of the material descriptions need to be added
> I did not include the SEAMIS data from the Indian Ocean region yet. Though I noted that the coordinates of Teluk Awur and Maldives are incorrect and should be fixed before being added to the database.
