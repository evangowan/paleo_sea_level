- Location values were not given in the original spreadsheets. I tried to track down the coordinates in the original papers, sometimes by approximating from the paper's map. If I could not find a download of the original publication, I approximated the location based on the site name in the spreadsheet
- Lewis told me that no correction was made for fractionation, so I made these corrections when appropriate. See https://github.com/evangowan/radiocarbon_labs
- For New South Wales, a lot of the samples from the Sloss 2007 compilation did not make it into the Lewis one. If the sample was in Lewis, I used that interpretation (which set them as sea level indicators with very conservative error bars). For the remaining points, I set them to be marine or terrestrial limiting as appropriate.
- Bulk radiocarbon errors are set to be 100 years, which was recommended in the HOLSEA documentation
- New South Wales reservoir age is -143+/-39, taken from five points from NSW in http://calib.org/marine/
- organic mud (with zostera) is set to use the terrestrial calibration with bulk correction
- Fractionation corrections are based on the values stated in Stuiver and Polach (1977), which can be found in the calibrate folder
- GaK ages are probably unreliable (see Blake 1980), but I have not made any correction.
- The Belpiro 2002 database for South Australia applied a 450 +/- 35 year correction to marine samples, which I had to revert to get back to conventional dates.
- There were discrepancies between the Belperio et al 1984 dates from Spencer Gulf and what were in the spreadsheets. I reverted everything to the original Belperio measurements. Although the dates have a "B" lab code, these are actually Beta dates and not Bern. I changed the lab code so that it says Beta.  According to the Belperio 1984 paper, everything was normalized to -25 permille, but in the spreadsheet derived from Belperio 2002, the dates did not use the 450 year correction for the Beta dates, so maybe not? The information I have would indicate that Beta had not started doing a fractionation correction at this point. I think I will still have to apply fractionation correction. Some of the ANU dates in the spreadsheet also do not have the 450 year correction applied, it is all very confusing. At any rate, I have switched everything back to the original 1984 reported conventional dates, and applied a fractionation correction to the Beta dates.
- The South Australia reservoir correction is  -83 +/- 62, which is based on 7 samples, mostly from the Spencer Gulf region near Adelaide
- It appears that seagrass samples should be reservoir corrected (as per Serrano et al 2016)
- The Belperio 1984 paper applied the marine correction to the samples labeled as "organics". I increased the uncertainty on the bulk resevoir correction to incorporate the 100 year bulk corection, so it is -83 +/- 118. I also applied the correction to the "hash" samples, and "mixed shells" samples
- A number of the dates from the Belperio 2002 dataset do not have any indication of the original references, and the locations can only be generally inferred from the name of the city
- The Lewis paper did not have a dataset for Tasmania, but there is somewhat of a dataset in the PHD thesis by Morrison. There isn't a lot of data, and much of it only gives calibrated dates.
- There are a bunch of dates in Murray-Wallace and Goede (1995) that are presented using a very early calibration. I have doubled the uncertainty to account for the likely difference with the modern calibration.
- I used two reservoir corrections for Western Australia. For places south of -21 N, I used -83+/-27, based on five points. For places north of -21 N, I used -91+/-31, based on 14 points
- The reservoir correction for Northern Territory is -109+/-40, which is based on only one data point
- I could not find the references to Bloom 1975 and 1980 in the Queensland dataset. I have referenced Hopley 1980, which gives a pers comms to Bloom
- Many of the dates from Chappell et al 1983 do not have a lab code, so I do not know what lab they are from. However, in the paper they state all the dates are corrected for fractionation, so there should be no problems.
- Most of the samples that are exclusively from Larcombe et al. 1995 do not have precise locations. They are described on the reefs the cores were from. Some do not have a reef where they are from, but presumably are from the same surveys around Flora Pass. I put the location in that area.
- There is no digital copy of Hopley 1983, so I approximated the location based on what is in the spreadsheet
- The reference Marshall 1995 does not exist. The dates listed as Marshall 1995 are actually from the Zwartz 1995 PHD thesis, with a pers comms from Marshall (and a reference to a paper that was never published). The exact location of where the data are from is not stated, just "near Cooktown"
- The lab codes from Larcombe et al 1995 are almost certainly from Wk (Waikato), though it is not explicitly stated in the paper.
- Ohlenbusch 1991 is an honours thesis that is not online, the location of the samples are just "mid-shelf", so the location is very approximate
- There are a number of samples without uncertainty ranges. For the mangroves from Zwartz, I set an uncertainty of 3 m, a bit more conservative than the rest of the mangroves from other studies since I do not know the context for which they assigned the errors. For marine samples without uncertainties, I set them to be marine limiting with an error of 1 m. For peat, I set them to be terrestrial limiting with an error of 1 m.
- The reservoir correction for Queensland is based on 12 points from coastal Queensland, -156+/-15
- For the Bonaparte Gulf samples from Nicholas et al 2014, I used the indicative meaning of +/-3 m for brackish samples, taken from Yokoyama et al 2000, and +15 m for the rest from Ishiwa et al 2019.
- In the general spreadsheet with samples from New Zealand and southeastern Asia, I only took the remaining samples from Australia, as there are newer compilations for the other areas.
- For Bonaparte Gulf, I took the Yokoyama 2000 definitions for data from that paper, and the Ishiwa et al 2019 definitions for values from that paper
