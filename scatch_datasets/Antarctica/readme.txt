- Most of the data are taken from the compilation by Briggs and Tarasov. There is an update by Lecavalier et al (in review), but I have not added this yet. The reservoir ages for Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea are taken from the Calib database. For the Windmill Islands, I use the reported correction. The penguin and seal remains use a custom reservoir correction. As per Heaton et al (2023), 150 years is subtracted from the old reservoir correction.
- Braddock et al 2022 - The reservoir age for these data was taken directly from the paper rather than from the Calib database, as it was already corrected for use in Marine20
- Ishiwa et al 2022 - There are no data points in the Calib database, so I used the values from the paper. As per Heaton et al (2023), 150 years is subtracted from the old reservoir correction. A nominal uncertainty of 100 years is also included.
