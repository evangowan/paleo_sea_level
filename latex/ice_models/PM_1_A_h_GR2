PM\_1\_A\_h\_GR2 - PaleoMIST 1.0 - full MIS 3 Laurentide Ice Sheet scenario, with Hudson Bay fully covered, and ice extent much larger. In this version, the sea level was calculated by linearly interpolating the ice load to 500 year time steps, which should mitigate some of the issues with overpredicting the loading in ice covered regions.  This includes a modified version of Greenland, where the shear stress values around the edges of Greenland have been increased by 20000 Pa, and lowered to the modern value between 12.5 and 7.5 ka. The shear stress in the center of Greenland has been reduced by 20000 Pa prior to 12.5 ka, and increased to the modern value at 7.5 ka.
