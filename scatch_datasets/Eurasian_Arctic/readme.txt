Northern_Russia.ods - From the Baranskaya et al (2018) Holsea formatted northern Russia dataset. I formatted this dataset in a pre-1.0 release, but hopefully there are no errors. I copied the original scratch datasets into this spreadsheet if I ever have the need to check again. I copied the formatted sheets from the current database. It appears that I took the radiocarbon ages from the corrected column, so the ages should be corrected for fractionation, and bulk ages have an extra 100 years applied to the uncertainty. Baranskaya et al took the reservoir ages from the Calib database, so I am updating that with the current values.
Creel_Russia.ods - The Creel et al (2022) database included one paper with Russian data that was not in the Baranskaya dataset. See the notes in the Europe folder for more details on what I did.
Lohne_Mangerud_Svalbard.ods - This is the data compiled by Ã˜ystein Lohne and Jan Mangerud for Svalbard (unpublished). This will be used until a new compilation by Stein Bondevik is completed.
Forman_Svalbard.ods - The Forman compilation was done in 2004. Any data that was in the the Lohne and Mangerud compilation has been removed from the final dataset. The marine and whale samples were corrected by 440 years for the reservoir effect. This has been changed back in the main database. Most of the samples described in the dataset are from raised beach deposits, and is referenced to high tide. Forman et al state the tidal range is generally less than 2 m. The beaches have an elevation range of 1-2 m, so this also limits the precision. To convert to a sea level indicator, I have subtracted 1 m from the stated elevation in the database, and used an uncertainty range of +/- 2 m. This might be an underestimate if the samples were from storm ridges (which are estimated to be at 4 m), but this is likely fine until the Bondevik compilation is ready. The Forman dataset does not include lat and long values. I had to find that info in the original papers.
