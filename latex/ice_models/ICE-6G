ICE-6G - the ice sheet reconstruction by the University of Toronto group \citep{ArgusEtal2014,PeltierEtal2015,PeltierEtal2018}. This particular run is the 1 degree grid ice thickness that goes back 122,000 years ago. The grid was interpolated using a nearest neighbour method to transform it to the grid used to create the grid used in SELEN. The simulation was run at 500 year time steps, so the ice load was linearly interpolated between the time steps when there were gaps.
