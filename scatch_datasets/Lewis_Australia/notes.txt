- Location values were not given in the original spreadsheets. I tried to track down the coordinates in the original papers, sometimes by approximating from the paper's map. If I could not find a download of the original publication, I apprixmated the location based on the site name in the spreadsheet
- Lewis told me that no correction was made for fractionation, so I made these corrections when appropriate. See https://github.com/evangowan/radiocarbon_labs
- For New South Wales, a lot of the samples from the Sloss 2007 compilation did not make it into the Lewis one. If the sample was in Lewis, I used that interpretation (which set them as sea level indicators with very conservative error bars). For the remaining points, I set them to be marine or terrestrial limiting as appropriate.
- Bulk radiocarbon errors are set to be 100 years, which was recommended in the HOLSEA documentation
- New South Wales reservoir age is -143+/-39, taken from five points from NSW in http://calib.org/marine/
- organic mud (with zostera) is set to use the terrestrial calibration with bulk correction
- Fractionation corrections are based on the values stated in Stuiver and Polach (1977), which can be found in the calibrate folder
- GaK ages are probably unreliable (see Blake 1980), but I have not made any correction.
- The Belpiro 2002 database for South Australia applied a 450 +/- 35 year correction to marine samples, which I had to revert to get back to conventional dates.
- There were discrepancies between the Belperio et al 1984 dates from Spencer Gulf and what were in the spreadsheets. I reverted everything to the original Belperio measurements. Although the dates have a "B" lab code, these are actually Beta dates and not Bern. I changed the lab code so that it says Beta.  According to the Belperio 1984 paper, everything was normalized to -25 permille, but in the spreadsheet derived from Belperio 2002, the dates did not use the 450 year correction for the Beta dates, so maybe not? The information I have would indicate that Beta had not started doing a fractionation correction at this point. I think I will still have to apply fractionation correction. Some of the ANU dates in the spreadsheet also do not have the 450 year correction applied, it is all very confusing. At any rate, I have switched everything back to the original 1984 reported conventional dates, and applied a fractionation correction to the Beta dates.
- The South Australia reservoir correction is  -83 +/- 62, which is based on 7 samples, mostly from the Spencer Gulf region near Adelaide
- It appears that seagrass samples should be reservoir corrected (as per Serrano et al 2016)
- The Belperio 1984 paper applied the marine correction to the samples labeled as "organics". I increased the uncertainty on the bulk resevoir correction to incorporate the 100 year bulk corection, so it is -83 +/- 118. I also applied the correction to the "hash" samples, and "mixed shells" samples
- A number of the dates from the Belperio 2002 dataset do not have any indication of the original references, and the locations can only be generally inferred from the name of the city
