This folder contains spreadsheets and raw datasets that I use to sort things for before entering 
into the "regions" datasets. I have set this up for my own purposes to keep things organized and 
backed up, so most things here are likely not of use to anyone but me.

Inside of each folder contains a bunch of spreadsheets, which are merged using the scripts in the python folder and moved to the main "regions" database. In most cases, the files are organized into a single "file_list.txt", but if there are special cases or different interpretations, they can be included in the "file_list_extra.txt", which adds the extra information (for instance, if you want to compare data using different assumed uplift rates). In file_list_extra.txt, there is a tab separated list of files, in the format:

file_name	appendage to the folder name	latex formatted appendage	gmt formatted appendage

To merge the data in a folder and move it to the main database, you run from this folder:

bash scripts/run_all_scripts.sh ${name of folder}

Provided that the file lists are there, it will move everything, and include the regions and reservoir corrections from the GIS files.
