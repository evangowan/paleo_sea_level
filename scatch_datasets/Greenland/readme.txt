General note:
Bulk sediment, gyttja and peat dates are given a correction of 0±100 years to account for bulk effects.
=========
Long et al 2011 - this compilation is done in a modern way, so all values are taken without any modification.
van Tatenhove 1996 west greenland - The ages are not corrected for fractionation, so I had to do this. I applied a 20% uncertainty to the stated elevation.
Berglund_Nuuk - this includes a couple papers by Berglund for the Nuuk area. These are all archaeological in nature, and therefore are terrestrial limiting. The elevation uncertainties are reported for some of the measurements, but others do not, so I applied a 20% uncertainty.
Nuup Kangerlua - this contains data from papers by Weidick 1972, Fredskild 1983, Weidick et al 2012 and McGovern et al., 1996. Some of the Fredskild data reports how the elevation was measured, but with no uncertainty. Gytjeso says it was measured with hand level. This is unlikely to have an uncertainty greater than 1 m, so that I have used that as the uncertainty. One sample, K-1036, is in a beach ridge, so this has been converted to an index point with IMCalc using the reported elevation range. The date Ua-3476 from Weidick et al 2012 is excluded because it is reworked. The radiocarbon dates are all from Copenhagen, everything that predates K-2455 has been corrected for fractionation.
Larsen et al 2014 - This paper doesn't report how they determined elevation, so  I applied a 20% uncertainty.
Hall et al 2010 - I used the reported ±5 m uncertainty for all of the data. The locations were estimated from a map overlain on Google Earth
Mesters Vig, Washburn and Stuiver 1962 - The samples are from diamiction (described as "till like material", possibly glaciomarine?) and deltaic sediments. I set everything to be marine limiting without further interpretation. The locations are based on a map in the paper, overlain on Google Earth. The shell dates were given a 550 correction, based on a modern shell date, so I added that back to get the conventional date. I assume that the dates were corrected for fractionation based on the notes from Yale University. I used the stated elevation uncertainties.
Mesters Vig,Trautman 1963 - I added all the Greenland samples from Isotopes III. They gave only limited details and measurements in imperial units. I applied a 20% uncertainty to the stated elevation.
Mesters Vig, Lasca 1966 - Several of the samples were reported with information on sea level position, which I have used as input into IMCalc (since the author did not state the exact estimated sea level range). They reported elevation uncertainties, which I have used. It also seems that the Michigan dates are corrected for fractionation.
Hjort 1981, NE Greenland - applied a 20% uncertainty on elevation measurements. Used a 140±100 reservoir age (the 100 years is the same as in Hall et al 2010). Most of the detailed information is in Lund XI.
Weidick 1977 - a radiocarbon date list. I converted the beach ridge data to index points using IMCalc
Weidick 1976 - a radiocarbon date list. I converted the beach ridge and beach data to index points using IMCalc. The Helsinki data sometimes had d13C measurements, which I used for correcting fractionation. I am assuming the Copenhagen dates were normalized to 0 permille, as per Funder (1982).
Lund Radiocarbon - I decided to do all the dates reported in Lund radiocarbon date lists together. They correct for fractionation. Some samples dated both the inner and outer fraction of the shells, I included only the inner fraction dates. I checked all 21 date lists that are found in the journal Radiocarbon and added any relevant Greenland data.
Funder 1971 - I added the relevant dates from this report.
Hjort and Funder 1974 - most of these dates are described in more detail in the Lund date lists, Lasca 1966, Washburn and Stuiver 1962 and Funder 1971.
Pedersen et al 2011 - They provide a detailed explanation of how their data relate to past sea level, and I have used their index points without modification. The coordinates were given in UTM, I converted them to lat/long using this website: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/utm-latitude-longitude-d_1370.html 
Christiansen et al 2002 - They provided interpretations of their data in terms of marine and terrestrial limiting. There is no information on elevation measurements, so I applied a 20% uncertainty.
Bennike and Wagner 2012 - No uncertainty was provided on the elevation, so I applied a 20% uncertainty.
Bjorck et al 1994a - I got the coordinates from Google Earth based on the map in the paper. I applied a 20% uncertainty on elevation, since it is not clear how they measured it.
Bjorck et al 1994 - only one date was regarded as being reliable (Lu-3275), so that is the only one I added.
Landvik 1994 - The dates were reported reservoir corrected, so I had to add 550 years. I assume everything here is marine limiting, the geological context is not given for some of the dates. There are a few dates with identical lab codes reported, these are suffixed with an underscore and number. The method of elevation measurement is not stated, so I applied a 20% uncertainty.
Bennike and Weidick 2001 - They regard all of the samples that they used for their sea level curve to be marine limiting. They think the driftwood and marine mammal fossils either were deposited below sea level, or had moved downslope. There is no mention of how they determined elevation, so I applied a 20% uncertainty.
NE Greenland Driftwood (Funder et al 2011) - this is a big compilation with 163 dates, of which 128 are from Funder et al 2011. Many marine shells that are reported are in situ and considered marine limiting. They also consider the reworked molluscs in beach deposits to be marine limiting, since they will be older than the beach. The driftwood is regarded to have been deposited 1-2 m above sea level by storms, but could possibly have moved downslope. Since I am being conservative, I have subtracted two meters from the driftwood elevations and set them to be marine limiting. They regard Portlandia as unreliable and excluded them from their sea level reconstructions, so I am as well. Some of the dates from older studies are found in older reports already added above, so they are not re-added here. Elevation values appear to have been extracted using photogrammetry from 1:50,000 scale aerial imagery, but since they do not state the vertical uncertainty level (which likely increases away from the coast, given their methods description), I apply a 20% uncertainty. The "correction for later growth" is applied via a correction in the radiocarbon dating step, I am using the original conventional date. I am considering all archaelogical dates to be terrestrial limiting. There is a column showing the reservoir corrected age, which shows 550 years for all marine samples, so it looks like the Copenhagen dates were already adjusted to -25 permille. The terrestrial material in table s2 appears to be terrestrial limiting
England 1985 - all of the samples were regarded as being marine limiting, including the driftwood. I checked the GSC dates from the revised table from 2005. England reports his altimeter measurements were consistently providing uncertainties of ±2 m, with validation done repeatedly, so this is what I have used.
Landvik et al 2001 - All of the dates are reported as normalized. The elevations were determined with altimeters, but no uncertainty ranges are not given, so I applied a 20% uncertainty. The elevations are referenced to the high tide mark, though the tidal range is only 20-30 cm, so that will be covered with the uncertainty range. For the diftwood, I used the correction as in Funder et al. 2011. The beach deposit (T-11772) is converted to an index point with IMCalc.
Ives et al 1964 - There are a few Greenland dates in this date list, which I have added. The driftwood sample is set as in Funder et al 2011. The elevations are reported in feet, so I rounded to the nearest meter. Some dates were from beach deposits, so I converted them using IMCalc. The errors are pretty large, so I do not know how useful these will be.
Weidick 1972 - There are two Weidick 1972, one is purely a date list, the other is a more substantive paper. I am adding all these date lists first and then going through the more substantive paper to see if anything is missing. As above, driftwood samples are considered marine limiting after subtracting 2 m from the given elevation. Some samples list an elevation uncertainty, which I used, otherwise I applied a 20% uncertainty.
Weidick 1973 - A number of samples in this list are unsuitable for inclusion, either because the elevation details are not given, or the sample is likely from a moraine deposit and is therefore unsuitable for reconstructing sea level. I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Weidick 1974 - I could only get four samples out of this date list since many did not have elevations reported. I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Weidick 1975 - For the wood sample, I used the same strategy as in Funder et al 2011. Except where noted, I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Funder 1982 - In the paper, it says that Copenhagen normalizes shells to 0 permile, though in all likelihood they do not perform any fractionation correction, since this was not mentioned in any of the Copenhagen date lists. I am using the standard corrections I used from Stuiver and Polach, 1977. I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Hjort 1987 - The Hjort paper doesn't explicitly state where the locations are. Luckily, they are listed in the paper by Funder et al 2011, so that is where I got the coordinates from. The relationship of the data with sea level are given in the paper. The beach deposits are converted to sea level index points using IMCalc. One sample is redeposited. This is not added. The sample Lu-3701 did not have a coordinate, so I used the coordinate of Lu-3700, which is likely close. The driftwood sample is converted to marine limiting as per Funder et al 2011. I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Moller et al 2010 - The coordinates are not in this paper, so they are taken from Funder et al 2011. The samples of unit "F" are from a proglacial lake and probably cannot be used to relate to sea level. The elevation was taken from a digital elevation model, but no uncertainty was provided, so I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Funder and Abrahamsen 1988 - This paper has a bunch of dates in a table, but most of them are from date lists that are already added. I only added the five dates that are exclusively from this paper.
Kelly and Bennike 1992 - This is a review paper of Northwestern Greenland. Only one relevant date is from this paper, but it points to a bunch of other papers with data, so this is used as a guide (the table in this paper does not contain any geological context for the dates, or precise locations). The elevations they reported in their surveys were with an altimeter, and they state that it has an uncertainty of ±5 m. As a result, I would regard any of the Kelly and Bennike data from this region with a maximum error of 5 m rather than 10 as used in other results (but still using the 20% criteria for elevations below 25 m). The portlandia dates are not used
Bennike 2002 - a lot of the dates in the table in this paper are not relevant to sea level reconstruction. There are a lot of paleotological samples. The paleotological samples were collected from the ground surface, so some may provide maximum constraints. No information on elevation measurements have been applied, so I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.
Fredskild 1985 - A digital version of this paper is not available online, but the google books preview allowed me to get the radiocarbon dates, the radiocarbon dates from Qeqertat. There are two shell dates and dates of sediment from a sediment core from a lake. The lake elevation was measured with a hand level, so I assume a minimal elevation error (1 m). Since I do not have access to all of the report, I had to just use a general location of Qeqertat for the coordinates. The Langesø date is available in Blake, 1987a
Funder 1990 - There is no information on how they measured the elevation, so I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements.  Samples in beach deposits are converted to index points with IMCalc. The sample K-4784 does not give an elevation, so I set the elevation to 0 m.
Kelly et al 1999 - This paper includes a number of deglacial marine shell dates. The ones labeled "Nuna" are included as marine limiting points. The elevations were approximated from section diagrams in the paper. Unfortunately, some of the dates do not have corresponding sections, so the elevation of those are unknown and cannot be added. No information was given on how the elevation was measured, so I applied a 20% uncertainty to elevation measurements. The locations were given on a map in the paper, and I extracted the coordinates from Google Maps. The ages were reported reservoir corrected to 400 years, this has been reverted
Gluder et al 2022 - They provide an innovative method to convert measured d18O values to infer the paleo water depth at which shells grew. Therefore they present the data as index points. Anna Glueder sent me a version of the spreadsheet with 2-sigma ranges, which I have used.
