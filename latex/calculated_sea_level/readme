In this folder, you should place your calculated sea level files. The files should be placed
into folders that are named after the ice sheet reconstruction you are using. The name of the
files should be "earth_model.dat", where "earth_model" is the name of the earth model
you are using.

The file "create_plots.sh" in the folder above creates the input files that are used to
access the files placed here. So it is important to have things in the format:

ice_sheet_model/earth_model.dat

Ultimately, the files are read into the FORTRAN program "extract_calc_sea_level", so it is
important to have the format of the file names correct.


The dat files themselves are text files that have a format like this (with header):

-------------------

 longitude latitude    0.0000     2.5000     5.0000     7.5000    10.0000 
 100.0000  13.0500     0.0000     1.6664    -0.9832    -1.4584   -18.8897 
 100.0000  13.7500     0.0000     1.8098    -0.6776    -0.4818   -17.7793 

-------------------

Note that the entries should be separated by spaces, not tabs or anything else!

The header row should start with "longitude latitude t(0) t(1) t(2)" and subsequently have the time
intervals of your calculated sea level data, in ka. The header is necessary, because the
pythons scripts use this to identify the ages!

The data will have the "longitude latitude sl(0) sl(1) sl(2) ...." and so on
