General note:
Bulk sediment, gyttja and peat dates are given a correction of 0Â±100 years to account for bulk effects.
=========
- Miyakojima - there is a script (Miyakojima_subaerial_age.sh) that calculates a terrestrial limiting point to account for the possible duration of subaerial exposure for the LGM corals found in Sasaki et al 2006.
- Kikaijima - I created two datasets, one using an assumed uplift rate of 1.9 mm/yr and the other at 2.1 mm/yr
