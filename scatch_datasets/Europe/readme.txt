Baltic.ods - This is the Rosentau et al 2021 HOLSEA dataset, without any modifications aside from putting it into my format
Vink North Sea - This is the Vink et al dataset, which is in a format comparable with HOLSEA. It seems that I also put in the data from the Scheder et al 2022 Holsea dataset
Rotterdam - this contains the HOLSEA dataset from Hijma and Cohen 2019 which covers Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
Limfjord - There was a gap between the Baltic and North Sea datasets in western Denmark, so I filled it with the data from this paper
Gehrels_Ho_Bugt - There was a gap between the Baltic and North Sea datasets in western Denmark, so I filled it with the data from this paper
Shennan_Sea_level_index_points_2022.ods - Ian Shennan kindly sent me an updated (ca. 2022) version of the British and Irish database, which includes all of the information that is needed to include in the database (the 2018 database lacked the information to calibrate the dates). The main thing here was tracking down all the references to add to the bibtex file. Two samples (HV7094 and HV7095) were already included in the Vink database, so I have placed them into a separate sheet and are not added from this database.
Irish_RSL_Database.ods - This is the Brooks and Edwards Irish sea level database, which is no longer online at the link described in the paper. I found this on Researchgate and assume it is complete. This is just for reference, since all of the data in here should also be in the Shennan et al database.
