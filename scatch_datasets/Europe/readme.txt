Baltic.ods - This is the Rosentau et al 2021 HOLSEA dataset, without any modifications aside from putting it into my format
Vink North Sea - This is the Vink et al dataset, which is in a format comparable with HOLSEA. It seems that I also put in the data from the Scheder et al 2022 Holsea dataset
Rotterdam - this contains the HOLSEA dataset from Hijma and Cohen 2019 which covers Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
Limfjord - There was a gap between the Baltic and North Sea datasets in western Denmark, so I filled it with the data from this paper
Gehrels_Ho_Bugt - There was a gap between the Baltic and North Sea datasets in western Denmark, so I filled it with the data from this paper
Shennan_Sea_level_index_points_2022.ods - Ian Shennan kindly sent me an updated (ca. 2022) version of the British and Irish database, which includes all of the information that is needed to include in the database (the 2018 database lacked the information to calibrate the dates). The main thing here was tracking down all the references to add to the bibtex file. Two samples (HV7094 and HV7095) were already included in the Vink database, so I have placed them into a separate sheet and are not added from this database. The location for the sample GU-910 was incorrect and I fixed it.
Irish_RSL_Database.ods - This is the Brooks and Edwards Irish sea level database, which is no longer online at the link described in the paper. I found this on Researchgate and assume it is complete. This is just for reference, since all of the data in here should also be in the Shennan et al database.
Faroe_Islands.ods - I could only find two studies with useable sea level data for the Faroe Islands, which are in this spreadsheet.
Creel_Norway.ods - This is the HOLSEA formatted dataset for Norway by Creel et al 2022. I found an error on sample ID 618, which had the incorrect age for a stratigraphic based date described originally as "The ingression contact occurs a few cm below the Allerød-YD boundary in the core, as inferred from the pollen record". The Date in the Creel database is only 1000, but based on the description, I have changed this to be 13000+/-100 based on it being below the Younger Dryas boundary, which is about 12900 kyr BP. There are a number of samples from Barnett et all that are from industrial period. For the purposes of the paleo sea level database, I have not included these. The "corrected" radiocarbon dates have a bulk error applied to them in applicable. My preference is to do this during the calibration process, so I have reverted the errors in my own list. The fractionation correction is of course applied, based on what Creel et al did. There seems to be two erroneous lines in the radiocarbon list that do not correspond to the lines from the long-form sheet. I have removed them and it appears that everything is aligned properly after that. I have adjusted the "unique sample ID" field to reflect this. The dates from Bakke et al 2005 were corrected for fractionation, but this is clearly an error since they should have already been corrected. I reverted the ages to what was in the original paper. For calibration of marine samples, I am using Normarine18 for samples that are older than 10900 radiocarbon years BP (the Normarine18 curve starts at 12200 cal yr BP, which is 10827 radiocarbon years BP). To ensure continuity, I appeneded the Marine20 curve with a reservoir correction of -133 ± 54 (as suggested by my collaborators from the DATED project). There are a few dates in this database that are in Russia. I have moved these to a separate spreadsheet in the Eurasian Arctic folder. Sample #1005 (T-520) should not be included. It is from a lake in the mountains, and it seems the elevation was incorrectly entered. I has not relevance to sea level.
